# Biostatistician, Epidemiolgist & PhD Researcher

I'm a statistician and quantitative epidemiologist, currently pursuing a PhD in Biomedical Sciences at KU Leuven, Belgium. My research focuses on the association between environmental stressors—especially heat—and health outcomes, using advanced statistical methods in epidemiology.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- Quantifying the **heat-health association** and identifying vulnerable populations  
- **Spatiotemporal modeling** (Bayesian & Frequentist)  
- **Environmental epidemiology**, chronic disease surveillance  
- Non-linear, longitudinal modeling, and survival analysis  
- Use of **distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM)** and **INLA** for health risk estimation  
- Presenting complex results using the ShinyApp tool  

## 📚 Academic Background
- 🎓 MSc in Statistics & Data Science, specialization in Quantitative Epidemiology  
- 🎓 MSc in Biostatistics  
- 🎓 BSc in Statistics  

## 🔧 Tools & Languages
- **R** (tidyverse, survival, DLNM, INLA, brms)  
- **Stata**, **SAS**, **SPSS**
- Shinyapp to present results intuitively 
- Data visualization, reproducible research (ggplot2, R Markdown)  
- Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration  
- LaTeX for document preparation  

## 🌍 Projects I'm Building Here
This GitHub profile showcases a growing collection of open and reproducible data analysis projects based on publicly available datasets, from basic statistical modeling to advanced spatial and Bayesian approaches.

Each project is structured to help learners and researchers understand statistical modeling in real-world public health and environmental contexts.

Stay tuned as I build out:
- Regression models (linear, logistic, Poisson)  
- Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Cox)  
- Spatial epidemiology  
- Time series modeling  
- Bayesian disease mapping  
- Distributed lag non-linear modeling (DLNM)
